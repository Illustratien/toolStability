@article{shukla1972,
 abstract = {The usual regression approach to explaining genotype-environment interaction is considered, using a non-additive model, and the statistical validity of the analysis is discussed. An alternative approach for dividing genotype-environment interaction into components, one corresponding to each genotype, is proposed, and the optimum properties are discussed. The alternative approach is then extended to take into account a covariate. The relationship of the new approach to the regression approach is discussed, and a numerical example is given},
