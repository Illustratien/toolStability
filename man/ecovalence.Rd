\title{Ecovalence}
\usage{
ecovalence(data, trait, genotype, environment, unit.correct = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a dataframe containing trait, genotype and environment.}

\item{trait}{colname of a column containing a numeric vector of interested trait to be analysized.}

\item{genotype}{colname of a column containing a character or factor vector labeling different genotypic varieties}

\item{environment}{colname of a column containing a character or factor vector labeling different environments}

\item{unit.correct}{logical, default is \code{FALSE}, returning the stability index with unit equals to squared unit of trait; when \code{TRUE}, returning stability index with the unit as same as unit of trait.}
}
\value{
a data table with ecovalence
}
\description{
\code{ecovalence} calculate genetic and environmental interaction.
}
\details{
Ecovalence (Wricke, 1962) is calcualted based on square and sum up the genotypeâ€“environment
interaction all over the environment.
Variety with low ecovalence is considered as stable.
Equation of ecovalence can be found in vignette file.
